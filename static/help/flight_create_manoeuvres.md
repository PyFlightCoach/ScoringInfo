Use this page to select the manoeuvres in your flight. You can either load the splitting from a FC Json file, or you can define it manually using the tools here. You can also adjust the splitting loaded from an FC Json file if you weren't able to split accurately between manoeuvres using the Flight Coach plotter.

#### Ribbon Manipulation and Point Selection

A ribbon diagram is shown along with a 3D model of a plane. You can use the slider at the bottom of the page to adjust the amount of ribbon you can see and you can click on the ribbon to move the plane. The position of the plane represents the selected point.

#### Manual Manoeuvre Definition

To manually define the manoeuvres it is best to work from the start of the flight to the end. The takeoff covers all the flight before the first manoeuvre and is automatically selected at the start.

1) click on the ribbon on the portion of straight line just before you enter the first manoeuvre.
 When you are happy with the selected location click on the Set button in the table or press the return key. 
2) A new row will appear to allow you to add the next manoeuvre, you can click on it or press return and the ribbon will automatically adjust to show the next portion of the flight.
3) Use the dropdown menu to select the next manoeuvre flown.
4) Repeat steps 1 to 3 for the rest of the flight until the entire flight is defined.

#### Notes
- The manoeuvre select dropdown will default to the next manoeuvre in the sequence, but you can select a different one if you wish. You will still be able to analyse the flight, but you wont be able to upload it unless a complete sequence was flown in order.
