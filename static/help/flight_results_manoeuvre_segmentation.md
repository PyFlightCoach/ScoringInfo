Use this page to adjust the element segmentation. There is lots more information about why you might need to do this here: <a href="https://pyflightcoach.github.io/ScoringInfo/elements" target=”_blank” >here</a>.


The ribbon plot in the middle of the page is coloured to identify the prinicipal elements within the manoeuvre. In almost all cases this will have been performed automatically and optimised to give you the kindest possible score for the manoeuvre. If you need to do this it is probably because the segmentation process has failed completely.

The objective is to align the principal elements (coloured regions) with the corresponding sections of flown data. You can click on the ribbon to select a principal element, then use the < and > buttons at the bottom of the page to adjust its end point along the flight path. You can adjust the size of the step with the number input. 

When you are happy with the segmentation you can use the *Optimise* and *Score* buttons at the bottom of the page to recalculate the score for the manoeuvre. Use the *score* button to calculate the score with the segmentation exactly as you set it. Use the *Optimise* button to run a segmentation optimisation process with your settings as the initial guess. 

For cases where the segmentation has failed, the best approach is to align the elements roughly, then to use the *optimise* button.
