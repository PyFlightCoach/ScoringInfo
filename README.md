## Flight Coach Score Help and Information

This repo contains the help and information docs for Flight Coach Score. It is hosted on hithub pages and accessed directly by the FCScore client. (flightcoach.org/fcscore)

The help documents for each page are linked to the markdown files in static/help, so static/help/flight_results.md will show in FCScore when you click on the question mark at the top of flightcoach.org/fcscore/flight/results. 

The svelte project itself is served [here](https://pyflightcoach.github.io/ScoringInfo/) and will contain supplementary information for FCScore users and for people who are interested in how the judging process works.
