<h1>Modelling Aerobatic Manoeuvres</h1>

<p>
Developing a computer model of an aerobatic sequence and the associated judging criteria is a fundamental part of the judging process. 
</p>

<h2>Principal Elements</h2>
<p>
  An aerobatic manoeuvre is formed from a group of principal elements flown sequentially. A principal element is a basic building block and may be a loop, line (or roll), snap, spin or stallturn. We will add support for tailslides in a future release. All of these elements have a set of parameters that can be used to scale them, or adjust their geometry in other ways. For example, a line element has a length, a speed and a roll angle to integrate along its length.

<p>
  As part of the judging process we have developed a method of automatically generating flight data to represent the principal elements and you have been able to view these template flights in the Flight Coach plotter for quite a while.
