<h2>Inter Element Assessment</h2>
<p>
  As well as defining the elements themselves, the aerobatic sequence model also defines the relationships between the controlling parameters of the principal elements. For example, if all the loops within a manoeuvre need to have the same radius, the lines before and after a roll need to have the same length or two roll elements need to have the same rate.
